See these 2 wild monkeys? Yup, that's us! We are all the same, in that we are all human. And yet, we specifically focus on our differences in a negative way. This manifests itself in us disliking, picking, bullying and/or being violent<!--more--> towards someone or a group of people based on their religion, color, caste, nationality, sexual orientation, race, political affiliation, income, body type, accent, intelligence, diet preferences, diseases, the way they look, the way they dress, the choices they make ...
 the list is endless.

Just take a short peek in time â€“ we have persecuted or treated each other in less than a dignified, human or fair way through history for being Black, being a Woman, being an inter-racial child, being an "illegitimate" child, questioning Catholicism and starting the Reformation, being a Catholic during Henry VIII's reign, being a Jew, being a Muslim, wearing a turban or a bindi (the "dot"), being obese, being gay, being a liberal, being a conservative, being poor, being rich, being stupid, being too smart, eating meat, having contracted AIDS, having pointy ears, being too short, not wearing the "in" brands ...
 you get the idea. And if you don't, then you just have to turn the "news" on.

While we are all the same, we will always have differences. And why would we not? We are all unique and thankfully so. That's what makes the world go around. And yet, we can't handle our differences. Why is that?

Firstly, we have this innate desire to pee all over and mark our territory. Secondly, it challenges our beliefs, stereotypes, values and insecurities to name a few. We've gathered these sentiments over time, many subliminally, and others through our upbringing, values taught at home and school, environment that we are exposed to, our observations and so on. And we hate being challenged or being wrong! And better yet, we hate to be honest with ourselves.

For the things that we don't understand, we have a tendency to lean towards dislike or hate. It requires effort and interest to learn and understand something that we don't know. And generally speaking, we are just too lazy. It's so much easier to dislike or hate. Furthermore, when we hate or put someone else down, it fulfills a need within us. It's a subliminal (or conscious) need of wanting to feel superior over others. And the classic way to do this is to put others down. I've certainly been the recipient of this many times over, as I am sure you have as well.

So why do we do this to each other?

When we look back in history and our current events, it would seem that we painfully learn from our past, but at a ridiculous turtle speed. Even the turtle's are laughing at us. The day that we want peace and happiness as deeply and badly as we want to hate or be at war today, is the day when we will finally have peace and be humans again.

Learning. Education. And greater understanding from a sincere and genuine place in our hearts is the key. Let's use this key moving forward! Let's learn to start loving our differences.
