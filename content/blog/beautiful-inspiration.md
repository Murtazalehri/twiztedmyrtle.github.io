My brother and I started our company, atmosol, 9 years back. We announced 3 days ago that I have decided to leave atmosol to pursue my new dreams and passion – photography and world travel amongst others. I've been blown away by the volume and content within the emails, texts, messages on FB/LI and phone calls that I have received. Looks like I may have a few people show up at my funeral in the future after all ![:)](/img/twiztedmyrtle/simple-smile.png) . Yay!

I heard from my friends & family, entrepreneur community, friends at Amazon, vendor partners and acquaintances. And then there were folks that just came out of the woodwork like my anesthesiologist, lady that sold me furniture eons ago, business leads from over 6 yrs ago that never materialized, former team members (apparently I didn't piss them off enough) and so on.

I would like to thank you all from the bottom of my heart for taking the time to write such beautiful and encouraging words. And many of you ventured to share your very personal stories with me. Thank you! I am overwhelmed and deeply touched by your love, support and trust. xoxo

I would like to share just a few of these responses. Firstly, so I can reference them for a boost and inspiration when I question myself and wonder if I've lost my marbles. Secondly, and more importantly, I want to share them with you as I feel that these responses are not just meant for me. Instead, they're really meant for <span style=\"color: #339966;\">**everyone**</span> who dares to dream and ventures out of their comfort zone into the unknown, in pursuit of their dream. They believe in their dream to the core and are willing to risk everything for it. So cheers to all of you who dare to dream and act on it, and those who dream and need a little support or encouragement to take that big leap.

I'm excited for you. Anyone who is willing to stop what they have been doing with what has been a comfort and a success for you, to pursue a lifelong dream, is a hero in my book.  Good for you. I offer all the encouragement and enthusiasm I have to you. Best of luck. I hope to see you down the road of life sometime. Best regards  –  RC

Wow! I am proud of you. You will be awesome  –  SA

Asha, A big congratulations to you for having the "guts", the "courage" to step outside the corporate and conventional world to pursue your true passion. I think it is great. Many of us dream about doing things, but instead we stay with the conventional "status quo" and never venture outside of our self-imposed boundaries. We are sometimes "afraid" of what people will think of us, we fear the "unknown", and we live lives of quiet desperation, never taking chances or risks which may bring us true happiness. So, honestly, I send you big KUDOS for what you are doing. Best to you always  –  RS

"Good Luck Asha! I want to see your photos everywhere!!!"  –  KC
