This is one of my most cherished photos that left an indelible impression on me. It captures the essence of life and human spirit in more ways than one.

Their home is the median of a very busy main road in [Bombay, India](http://twiztedmyrtle.photoshelter.com/gallery-collection/View-Gallery/C0000qSXIepKx7lw). All of their precious belongings are clearly on display that include a battered and probably unhygienic mattress, make shift pillow, clothes and containers. The girl's right leg is on the street with cars narrowly scraping by her, drivers are honking and inching through the chaos, bikers are anxiously seeking an opening so they can zip through traffic, people are jay walking, street vendors are hustling with their customers ...
 the noise is unbearable.

And yet, amongst that overwhelming chaos and noise are three kids who find themselves in an entirely different world. There is not a care for what they have, where they are and what's going on around them. They are lost and immersed within themselves where there is immense happiness and pure joy. It's in their eyes and laughter; you can see it and you can hear it. The interaction between the girl and the child is simply priceless. It's what we all crave for. The interaction between the boy and the child is heart wrenching as you can tell that the boy has had to grow up very quickly, at the expense of not having much of a childhood himself.

We choose to get lost in the race to acquire the latest gadgets, own the biggest house, drive the fanciest cars, adorn ourselves with luxury brands ...
 all to create an image of how we want others to see ourselves, to help define who we are because our character is not rich enough to compete with such possessions. We choose to get upset with our loved ones about things that really don't matter as routine and habit.

This moment captures the essence of life – love and beautiful interactions between two souls. These kids may not have much, but they have everything that we crave for everyday in our lives ...
 love and happiness through meaningful relationships.



PS – This shot was taken from a moving vehicle. I had just a few seconds to notice these kids interacting in the median of the road, registering that this was worthy of capturing and then actually getting the shot while in a moving vehicle.
