Photography is so much about perspective. Photos convey one aspect of the truth, but not always the entire truth or reality. There just may be another side to the story. <!--more--> As I have discovered this through my photography, I have fallen in love with this art even more.

I hope to share with you the inside scoop, fun travel stories, my sentiments, ask questions and challenge our thoughts in pursuit of greater understanding and truth. I am excited about exploring the world we live in together with you.

Perhaps this summarizes it best …  "To create an alternative future, we cannot reproduce rethinking that shape our past. And yet we will, if we don't challenge the forces that have shaped who we are and what we do. The more we understand the effect the world has had on us, the more we can control the effect we have on the world" - The Lottery of Birth.

Join my twizted myrtle family and let's get started on this twisted, fun and mind bending journey.

Love,

Asha Wadher
