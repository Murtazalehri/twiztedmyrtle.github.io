Meet Sara. It would be fair to say that she's been through hell and back. Sara sheds light on how her perpetrator groomed her for one year to become a victim of sexual abuse. How did he get in her mind? What drove her to cut her body with a razor and become addicted to it? How did she get introduced to drugs?

Her reasons were profound! She left me speechless.  <a href="http://doublewidenetwork.s3.amazonaws.com/twizted_myrtle/Twizted_Myrtle_Episode1_Sarah_Final6.mp3" target="_blank">Listen to Show</a>
